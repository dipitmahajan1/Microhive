            "1 Introduction\n",
            "Major economic news, such as FOMC announcements, natural disasters, or geopolitical con-\n\ufb02icts, impact \ufb01nancial markets by triggering jumps in related high-frequency stock prices (Li\net al., 2017, document empirical examples of this phenomenon). Statistical tests for these\ncommon jump events, known as \u201ccojump tests\u201d, implicitly assume that jumps happen at the\nsame time across all relevant assets but, in fact, jumps occur asynchronously in transaction\ndata. Empirical studies support this view: stock prices can move sluggishly (Bandi et al.,\n2017), jumps may develop gradually (Barndor\ufb00-Nielsen et al., 2009), jumps of less-liquid in-\ndividual assets typically lag those of the more-liquid market index (Li et al., 2017), and at an\nultra-high frequency, cojumps are spurious (Bajgrowicz et al., 2016). Most researchers have\ndealt with this problem by settling for a coarse sampling grid (Barndor\ufb00-Nielsen et al., 2009;\nBollerslev et al., 2008; Lahaye et al., 2011; Li et al., 2019). Such a coarse grid guards against\nmicrostructure e\ufb00ects, the frictions with which actual trades take place, but it is restrictive\nin that it oversmooths actual changes (A\u00a8\u0131t-Sahalia, 2004).\n",
            "We propose an alternative approach to recover the common jump in a basket of stocks\non a \ufb01ne sampling grid. Our method assumes that the exchange-traded fund (ETF) price\ntracks the latent, equilibrium (also often called \u201ce\ufb03cient\u201d) value of a stock index, and that\nsluggish news impoundment creates a spread between the value of a synthetic index and the\ne\ufb03cient ETF price. We rearrange stock price jumps in time to minimize this spread and thus\n(approximately) recover the latent, common, e\ufb03cient jump.\n",
            "Combinatoric methods optimally rearrange asynchronous jumps. We extend the pioneer-\ning work of Puccetti and R\u00a8uschendorf (2012) and Embrechts et al. (2013) on rearrangements.\nTheir algorithm is best known for actuarial applications, but can also be applied to other\ndisciplines, such as option pricing (e.g., Bondarenko and Bernard, 2023) and operations re-\nsearch (e.g., Boudt et al., 2018). Rearrangements can also synchronize stock jumps on a \ufb01ne\nsampling grid, provided we penalize economically implausible rearrangements. For example,\nwe only allow for a rearrangement of jumps backward in time because we assume that stock\nprices are sluggish and lag the highly liquid and carefully watched ETF, they do not lead it.\nTo operationalize this, we introduce the \u201cRearrangement Mixed-Integer Linear Program.\u201d\n",
            "We apply our methods to investigate the reactions of Dow 30 stock prices in event win-\ndows around DIA ETF jumps. For example, the Federal Reserve announced rate cuts on\nSeptember 18, 2007, at 14:15 US Eastern Time, after which markets took up to \ufb01ve minutes\nto incorporate the Fed\u2019s news into the Dow 30 stock\u2019s prices. Rearrangements synchronize 19\n(out of 23) scattered stock jumps with the ETF jump, approximately recovering the common\njump in the stocks. This is not an isolated incident: our linear program rearranges stock\njumps during 180 separate cojump events.\n",
            "Synchronizing mistimed stock returns improves estimates of the daily realized covariance\nmatrix and improves the out-of-sample \ufb01nancial performance compared to using raw returns.\nWhile other estimators, like the multivariate realized kernel in Barndor\ufb00-Nielsen et al. (2011)\nor a Cholesky factorization in Boudt et al. (2017), protect against mild market microstructure\nnoise and the Epps (1979) e\ufb00ect (that is, the downward bias in covariance estimates due to\nasynchronous trading), they do not protect against the underestimation of jump dependence\ndue to asynchronous jumps.\n",
            "We proceed as follows. Section 2 details the synchronization method using a toy example.\nSection 3 illustrates an empirical example of a rearranged sluggish cojump in the Dow 30\nand includes a portfolio allocation exercise. Section 4 concludes.\n",

We rearrange stock price jumps in time to minimize this spread and thus\n(approximately) recover the latent, common, e\ufb03cient jump.\n",
            "Combinatoric methods optimally rearrange asynchronous jumps. We extend the pioneer-\ning work of Puccetti and R\u00a8uschendorf (2012) and Embrechts et al. (2013) on rearrangements.\nTheir algorithm is best known for actuarial applications, but can also be applied to other\ndisciplines, such as option pricing (e.g., Bondarenko and Bernard, 2023) and operations re-\nsearch (e.g., Boudt et al., 2018). Rearrangements can also synchronize stock jumps on a \ufb01ne\nsampling grid, provided we penalize economically implausible rearrangements. For example,\nwe only allow for a rearrangement of jumps backward in time because we assume that stock\nprices are sluggish and lag the highly liquid and carefully watched ETF, they do not lead it.\nTo operationalize this, we introduce the \u201cRearrangement Mixed-Integer Linear Program.\u201d\n",
            "We apply our methods to investigate the reactions of Dow 30 stock prices in event win-\ndows around DIA ETF jumps. For example, the Federal Reserve announced rate cuts on\nSeptember 18, 2007, at 14:15 US Eastern Time, after which markets took up to \ufb01ve minutes\nto incorporate the Fed\u2019s news into the Dow 30 stock\u2019s prices. Rearrangements synchronize 19\n(out of 23) scattered stock jumps with the ETF jump, approximately recovering the common\njump in the stocks. This is not an isolated incident: our linear program rearranges stock\njumps during 180 separate cojump events.\n",
            "Synchronizing mistimed stock returns improves estimates of the daily realized covariance\nmatrix and improves the out-of-sample \ufb01nancial performance compared to using raw returns.\nWhile other estimators, like the multivariate realized kernel in Barndor\ufb00-Nielsen et al. (2011)\nor a Cholesky factorization in Boudt et al. (2017), protect against mild market microstructure\nnoise and the Epps (1979) e\ufb00ect (that is, the downward bias in covariance estimates due to\nasynchronous trading), they do not protect against the underestimation of jump dependence\ndue to asynchronous jumps.\n",
            "We proceed as follows. Section 2 details the synchronization method using a toy example.\nSection 3 illustrates an empirical example of a rearranged sluggish cojump in the Dow 30\nand includes a portfolio allocation exercise. Section 4 concludes.\n",

The scattering of red dots away from (1,1)\nillustrates that optimally changing the time labels of one of two observations (out of the\n390 one-minute returns required to estimate the realized covariance) changes the estimated\ncovariance structure between the stocks and the ETF returns on the day of the FOMC\nstatement. For example, the fact that the statistics in the left panel generally lay above the\n45-degree line shows that rearranging the jumps of HPQ, which jumps gradually, increases\nits variance and most covariances with other stocks. The right panel shows that rearranging\nthe jumps of PFE, which jumps with an overreaction, reduces its own variance and all the\ncovariances with PFE returns.\n",

            "Stock returns determine the weights that minimize the portfolio variance. The optimal\nweights for a particular day minimize the portfolio variance, subject to the constraints that\nthey deliver a given expected return and that they sum to one (Markowitz, 1952):\n",

We make a grid of 100 target returns that range from the lowest average\nDJIA stock return to the highest one. To test our synchronization procedure, we compare a\nsimulated portfolio\u2019s performance using raw vs. rearranged returns to compute the realized\ncovariance matrix.\n",
            "We optimize weights (31) on rearrangement days, i.e. the 184 ETF jump days for which\nwe rearrange jumps and use those weights to rebalance the portfolio the next day. We keep\nthose weights until the next rearrangement day. In those cases when the Dow constituency\nchanges in between rearrangement days, we reset to an equally weighted portfolio until the\nnext rearrangement day.\n",

For 12 of 14 years and over the whole sample, the rearranged-return\nportfolio statistics are superior to the raw-returns portfolio statistics in terms of the modi\ufb01ed\nSharpe ratio. Over the full sample, the modi\ufb01ed Sharpe ratios are signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent and\nthe rearranged-return portfolio delivers an additional 5% performance.\n",

Gray cells denote the higher\nof the two performance statistics. Dark gray cells denote statistically signi\ufb01cant superiority at\nthe 10% level. To calculate the modi\ufb01ed Sharpe ratio, we use excess returns vs. the DIA ETF.\nWe rely on the studentized circular bootstrap approach, with 1000 bootstrap replications and a\nblock length of 5, to infer the statistical signi\ufb01cance of di\ufb00erences in Sharpe ratios.\n",

            "In a panel of intraday stock returns, sampled on a \ufb01ne sampling grid, jumps occur at close but\ndistinct points in time. We introduce tools to synchronize the scattered jumps and better\napproximate the common jump. The rearrangement is currently very practical, requiring\nonly a few seconds for a rearrangement problem with 30 stocks.\n",
            "Estimating realized covariance matrices with synchronized stock returns, as opposed to\nraw returns, improves out-of-sample portfolio performance. Recovering the common jump on\na \ufb01ne sampling grid is likely to improve other asset allocation and risk management decisions,\nlike estimating the jump size distribution (see e.g., Boudt et al., 2011a), estimating jump\ndependence (see e.g., Li, Todorov, Tauchen, and Chen, 2017; Li, Todorov, and Tauchen, 2017;\nLi, Todorov, Tauchen, and Lin, 2019) or forecasting realized measures (see e.g., Andersen\net al., 2007; Bollerslev et al. 2020; Bollerslev et al., 2022). A more thorough analysis must,\nhowever, await future work.\n",

From left to right, the columns report the\noptimization with raw vs.\nnumber of days (Days), the number of ETF jumps or cojump days (#CJ) and the number of\ncojump days on which the rearrangement moves stock jumps (#CJ-R). \u201cClosing value\u201d is the\nend-of-sample portfolio value if the initial value was $1 using cumulative daily returns. \u201cSD\u201d\nand \u201cmSharpe\u201d are the standard deviations and modi\ufb01ed Sharpe ratios and the p-value of their\ndi\ufb00erence (Ardia and Boudt, 2015) of the portfolio over the sample. Gray cells denote the higher\nof the two performance statistics. Dark gray cells denote statistically signi\ufb01cant superiority at\nthe 10% level. To calculate the modi\ufb01ed Sharpe ratio, we use excess returns vs. the DIA ETF.\nWe rely on the studentized circular bootstrap approach, with 1000 bootstrap replications and a\nblock length of 5, to infer the statistical signi\ufb01cance of di\ufb00erences in Sharpe ratios.\n",

            "4 Concluding remarks\n",
            "In a panel of intraday stock returns, sampled on a \ufb01ne sampling grid, jumps occur at close but\ndistinct points in time. We introduce tools to synchronize the scattered jumps and better\napproximate the common jump. The rearrangement is currently very practical, requiring\nonly a few seconds for a rearrangement problem with 30 stocks.\n",
            "Estimating realized covariance matrices with synchronized stock returns, as opposed to\nraw returns, improves out-of-sample portfolio performance. Recovering the common jump on\na \ufb01ne sampling grid is likely to improve other asset allocation and risk management decisions,\nlike estimating the jump size distribution (see e.g., Boudt et al., 2011a), estimating jump\ndependence (see e.g., Li, Todorov, Tauchen, and Chen, 2017; Li, Todorov, and Tauchen, 2017;\nLi, Todorov, Tauchen, and Lin, 2019) or forecasting realized measures (see e.g., Andersen\net al., 2007; Bollerslev et al. 2020; Bollerslev et al., 2022). A more thorough analysis must,\nhowever, await future work.\n",

        "Stock prices often react sluggishly to news, producing gradual jumps and jump delays. Econometricians typically treat these sluggish reactions as microstructure effects and settle for a coarse sampling grid to guard against them. Synchronizing mistimed stock returns on a fine sampling grid allows us to better approximate the true common jumps in related stock prices."
